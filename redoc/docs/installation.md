# Installation

The Common Gateway can be installed in full, or partly. The Full installation is provided with a Graphical Interface. This GUI is a handy tool to navigate and use a lot of the functionality of the Common Gateway, but as the back end part is more advanced by default, it's lacking a bit behind the back end counterpart.
